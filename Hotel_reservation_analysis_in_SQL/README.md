# Hotel Reservation Analysis with SQL
In this Project, we will use SQL to answer the questions related to dataset. This will help us to develop 
data analysis skills in a practical context. 

## Overview:
The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and enhance the overall guest experience. In this project, we delve into a comprehensive hotel reservation dataset to extract meaningful insights. Our goal is to uncover guest preferences, Identify booking trends, and discover key factors influencing how the hotel operates. 

## Dataset Details:
The dataset includes the following columns: 
- Booking_ID: A unique identifier for each hotel reservation.
- no_of_adults: The number of adults in the reservation. 
- no_of_children: The number of children in the reservation.
- no_of_weekend_nights: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on 
weekends. 
- no_of_week_nights: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on 
weekdays. 
- type_of_meal_plan: The meal plan chosen by the guests. 
- room_type_reserved: The type of room reserved by the guests.
- lead_time: The number of days between booking and arrival.
- arrival_date: The date of arrival. 
- market_segment_type: The market segment to which the reservation 
belongs. 
- avg_price_per_room: The average price per room in the reservation. 
- booking_status: The status of the booking. 

## Objective:

Our objective is to leverage SQL for in-depth exploration and analysis of the 
dataset. By addressing specific queries related to the dataset, our goal is to reveal patterns that will guide strategic decisions and optimize the overall performance of the hotel.

## Tool used:
`My SQL`

## Questions:

1. What is the total number of reservations in the dataset? 
2. Which meal plan is the most popular among guests?
